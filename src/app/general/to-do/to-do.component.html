    <p>
        This is likely to be a very long list, but for now, I'm going to try to track all of stuff that will need to be done over time.
        A lot of the server side functionality is already present as a Spring Boot app running on an AWS t3a.small EC2 instance.
        Most of the work below is strictly UI work.
