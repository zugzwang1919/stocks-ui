    <h2 style="text-align:center">Welcome</h2>
    <p> Welcome to my rather amateurish website.  My goal here (and hopefully yours too) is to see whether or not I'm making meaningful stock selections or would just be
        better off buying a simple index ETF (like SPY) or Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 Index Fund.

        <h4>Create Your Own Account </h4>
    <p class="second-level">
        From <a href="">here</a>, you can create your own account.
    </p>
    <h4> Or... Use a Shared Account </h4>
    <p class="second-level">
        If you just want to mess around feel free to use the following credentials:<br>
        <font color="#0099da"> User Name: </font> anonymous<br>
        <font color="#0099da"> Password: </font> password<br>
    </p>
    <h4> Ready to Give it a Try? </h4>
    <p class="second-level">
        After logging in, you can create the securities that you plan to buy and sell using the "Securities" pages.
    </p>
    <p class="second-level">
        Next, you should enter your BUYs and SELLs on the "Transactions" pages.
    </p>
    <p class="second-level">
        Finally, you will then be able to analyze the BUYs and SELLs vs benchmark transactions on the "Calculations -> Performance vs Benchmark"
        page.
    </p>
    <h4>Caveats</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This is most definitely a work in progress.  Don't make any investment decisions without double-checking these calculations.
        </li>
        <li>
            All of the returns are "simple" return calculations.  On the wishlist... supporting Internal Rate of Return / Annualized Return calculations.
        </li>
        <li>
            This website is running on an Amazon t2.small EC2 instance.  Please be tolerant of some poor performance.  Maybe some day, I'll upgrade to a
            "real" server.
        </li>
        <li>
            It's probably worth noting that I have primarily tested with Google's Chrome browser and a little with Mozilla's Firefox.
        </li>
    </ul>

        If you have any comments, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@wolfe-software.com?subject=Feedback for wolfe-software.com">contact me.</a>
        And most importantly...  Happy investing!
